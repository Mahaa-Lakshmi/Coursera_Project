# Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask

## Course Overview

This course covered the entire application development lifecycle, emphasizing essential phases that contribute to building robust web applications. By the end of this course, you will understand the following stages:

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting user, business, and technical requirements for the application.
2. **Analysis**: Analyzing the collected requirements to identify the best approach.
3. **Design**: Creating a comprehensive design for the solution.
4. **Code and Test**: Building and testing various components of the application.
5. **User and System Test**: Conducting usability tests with users, and performing system integration and performance testing.
6. **Production**: Making the application available for end users.
7. **Maintenance**: Upgrading and fixing any user or system issues as they arise.

## Key Concepts

- All web apps are APIs, but not all APIs are web apps. While both share data between applications, web apps specifically require network connectivity.
  
- **PEP8 Guidelines for Code Readability**:
  - Use four spaces for indentation.
  - Separate functions and classes with blank lines.
  - Include spaces around operators and after commas.

- **PEP8 Coding Conventions**:
  - Encapsulate larger blocks of code within functions.
  - Name functions and files in lowercase using underscores.
  - Use CamelCase for class names.
  - Define constants in uppercase with underscores separating words.

- **Static Code Analysis**: A method to ensure your code adheres to predefined styles and standards without executing it.

- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual code units to ensure they function as intended before integration into the final codebase.

## Creating a Package

To create a Python package:
1. Create a folder with the desired package name.
2. Add an empty `__init__.py` file.
3. Create the required modules.
4. Reference the necessary modules in the `__init__.py` file.

You can verify the package in a bash terminal within a Python shell.

## Frameworks and Libraries

- **Flask**: A lightweight microframework that allows the building of web applications with minimal dependencies. Key features include:
  - Debugging servers
  - Routing
  - Templating
  - Error handling
  
- **IBM Watson Libraries**: These are embeddable libraries installed in the Cloud IDE framework, providing various NLP and speech functionalities based on popular AI models.

## Projects

In this course, you developed web applications with integrated AI functionality using IBM Watson libraries. The projects followed these steps:

1. Create a function for the application.
2. Package the application function.
3. Run unit testing on the function.
4. Deploy the application using Flask.
5. Incorporate error handling.
6. Perform static code analysis on the created code.

### Final Project: Emotion Detection System

The final project involved creating an **Emotion Detection System** using Flask. The following steps were executed:
- Created a function for the application.
- Packaged the application function.
- Conducted unit testing.
- Deployed the application on the web using Flask.
- Incorporated error handling.
- Executed static code analysis on the developed code.
